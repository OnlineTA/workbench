workbench â€” a testbed for OnlineTA tests

See the ./assignments/ subdirectory for some sample assignments. For each of
them, there are a couple sample good and bad solutions under
./submissions/<assignment>/.

For instance, you might consider running:

  $ ./workbench ./assignments/c-stackcalc/ ./submissions/c-stackcalc/good/
